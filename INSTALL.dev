Make sure you have a jre and postgres dev libraries installed, you'll also 
need libxml2 (and maybe other libraries) needed to satisfy gem requirements.

1) Install rvm, version 1.6.18. This is necessary because we need an older 
version of rubygems to work with rails 2.3. The details of rvm installation are
on the rvm website.
  curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s -- --version 1.6.18

2) Install ree-1.8.7
  rvm install ree

3) Check out h2o. cd into the directory and create a gemset and rvmrc to set up the
correct environment
  git clone https://github.com/berkmancenter/h2o.git h2o
  cd h2o
  rvm use ree
  rvm gemset create rails2
  rvm use ree@rails2 --rvmrc
  cd ../ && cd h2o/ 
  # Accept the rvmrc prompt, you should now be in the correct version of ruby and 
  # and empty gemset

4) Install rails 2.3.14 and other gems needed to even get rake to work:
  gem install rails --version=2.3.14 --no-ri --no-rdoc
  gem install sunspot_rails --version=1.1.0
  gem install pg

5) Create the database (postgres only for now). Set up config/database.yml to connect to it.

6) Install the rest of the gems, run migrations:
  rake gems:install
  # if you have a pg_dump, restore that into the database referenced in config/database.yml
  rake db:migrate

7) Configure solr in config/sunspot.yml. Start via:
  rake sunspot:solr:start

8) Set up passenger standalone:
  gem install passenger
  passenger start -p 3000

and you should now be able to connect on http://localhost:3000/
