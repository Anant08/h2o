User "<%= @record.user.simple_display %>" has made the <%= @record.class == Default ? "Link" : (@record.class == TextBlock ? "Text" : @record.class.to_s) %> "<%= @record.name %>" private. This item had been included on your playlist "<%= @playlist.name %>" and now there will be a grayed-out indicator for it where it used to be on your playlist. (That item will no longer be accessible on that playlist because it was set to private.) Please visit your playlist to add other items or to delete the grayed-out version of the former item.
